## ABSTRACT</br>

<p>This capstone research proposal explores the use of blockchain technology as a solution to
mitigate electoral fraud and inefficiencies in the electoral process. Blockchain offers an
innovative perspective by providing verifiable audit trails, enabling immediate and
independent verification of electoral records. The fundamental features of blockchain, such as
decentralization and immutability, have the potential to radically transform traditional
electoral auditing practices. This research will analyze in detail the advantages and
disadvantages of adopting blockchain for electoral audits, highlighting elements such as
transparency, immutability, and distributed consensus. Exploring smart contracts and digital
signatures will be at the core of our study, aiming to strengthen audit procedures and ensure
the reliability of electoral records. This study will combine qualitative and quantitative
research approaches, including literature analysis, case studies, and interviews with domain
experts. The ultimate goal of this research is to provide a comprehensive understanding of
how blockchain integration can enhance the efficiency of the electoral process and the
accuracy of results, thereby contributing to trust in the integrity of elections. </p>

## INTRODUCTION</br>

<p>Electoral fraud and inefficiencies in the electoral process pose significant challenges to
modern democracy. In an increasingly digitized world, it is imperative to find innovative and
reliable ways to ensure the integrity and transparency of elections. It is in this context that our
synthesis project, titled "Mitigate Electoral Fraud and Inefficiencies Through Verifiable Audit
Trails," takes shape.</p>
<p>Blockchain technology has already proven its effectiveness in various fields, including secure
and transparent management of financial transactions. In a traditional electoral process,
inefficiencies and fraud risks persist because auditors often rely on third parties to verify the
accuracy of records. This approach can be costly, prone to human errors, and potentially
subject to manipulation.</p>
<p>Blockchain offers a revolutionary alternative. It allows direct verification of records from
their creation, eliminating the need for third parties and significantly reducing the risk of
human error or fraud. Furthermore, it offers the possibility of instant verification, enabling the
identification and prevention of electoral fraud faster than ever before.</p>
<p>In this project, we will explore how blockchain technology can be implemented to ensure fair,
transparent, and efficient elections. We will examine the advantages of blockchain for
electoral processes and identify the challenges that must be overcome to fully leverage its
potential.</p>
<p>We firmly believe that this synthesis project can make a significant contribution to democracy
by strengthening citizens' trust in the electoral process. By providing a comprehensive
overview of blockchain's potential for electoral auditing, we hope to assist key stakeholders,
including electoral authorities and citizens, in understanding the benefits of this technology
and developing strategies to ensure fair and verifiable elections.</p>

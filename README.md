## INTRODUCTION

<p>Electoral fraud and inefficiencies in the electoral process pose significant challenges to modern democracy. In an increasingly digitized world, it is imperative to find innovative and reliable ways to ensure the integrity and transparency of elections. It is in this context that our synthesis project, titled "Reduce Voter Fraud Inefficiencies with Verifiable Audit Trails," takes shape. Blockchain technology has already proven its effectiveness in various fields, including secure and transparent management of financial transactions. In a traditional electoral process, inefficiencies and fraud risks persist because auditors often rely on third parties to verify the accuracy of records. This approach can be costly, prone to human errors, and potentially subject to manipulation.</p>
<p>Blockchain offers a revolutionary alternative. It allows direct verification of records from their creation, eliminating the need for third parties and significantly reducing the risk of human error or fraud. Furthermore, it offers the possibility of instant verification, enabling the identification and prevention of electoral fraud faster than ever before. In this project, we will explore how blockchain technology can be implemented to ensure fair, transparent, and efficient elections. We will examine the advantages of blockchain for electoral processes and identify the challenges that must be overcome to fully leverage its potential. We firmly believe that this synthesis project can make a significant contribution to democracy by strengthening citizens' trust in the electoral process. By providing a comprehensive overview of blockchain's potential for electoral auditing, we hope to assist key stakeholders, including electoral authorities and citizens, in understanding the benefits of this technology and developing strategies to ensure fair and verifiable elections.</p>

<HR>

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

<p>Our synthesis project, titled "Reduce Voter Fraud and Inefficiencies Through Verifiable Audit Trails," stems from the observation that current electoral processes are susceptible to fraud and inefficiencies due to insufficient trust in existing verification systems. Electoral fraud and inefficiencies in the electoral process undermine citizens' confidence in the democratic system. These issues can lead to non-representative outcomes and widespread mistrust, threatening the stability of governments and the legitimacy of elections. It is imperative to ensure the integrity and efficiency of the electoral process to maintain democracy. Stakeholders affected by this issue include voters, electoral bodies responsible for organizing elections, political parties participating in polls, as well as electoral observers and civil society monitoring elections. All these stakeholders have a direct interest in ensuring that elections are fair, transparent, and efficient. While seeking to address this problem, it is essential to ensure that the proposed solutions do not introduce new barriers to electoral participation and guarantee equal opportunities for all voters. The principles of transparency, fairness, and trust in the electoral process must be upheld. Our project aims to explore and propose solutions based on verifiable audit trails to reduce electoral fraud and inefficiencies. This could include the use of technologies such as blockchain to secure and make transparent the electoral process, the implementation of mechanisms for vote verifiability, voter education on these new technologies, and the involvement of independent organizations in auditing the electoral process. These approaches will help build trust in elections and ensure fairer and more representative results.</p>

<HR>

## SOLUTION STATEMENT
<p>To address the problem of electoral fraud and inefficiencies in the electoral process, our solution will rely on verifiable audit trails, building upon the approach proposed in the project titled "Reduce Voter Fraud Inefficiencies with Verifiable Audit Trails." This will ensure a more transparent, efficient, and secure electoral process. We propose adopting blockchain technology to secure and make transparent the electoral
process, just as it is used for financial and non-financial records in the previous project. Blockchain will ensure the integrity of electoral data by recording each vote in an immutable and transparent manner. We will also explore the use of smart contracts and digital signatures to strengthen the audit procedure. The ultimate goal of our research is to provide a comprehensive understanding of how blockchain can transform the electoral process, increase efficiency, accuracy, and trust in electoral records keeping. This approach will contribute to the advancement of electoral auditing practices, thus strengthening democracy by reducing electoral fraud and improving the efficiency of elections.</p>

### Proposed Solutions
Building on existing structures, the Unique ID (UID) of voters which could be students' registration number in their respective schools, or Voter Identification Number (VIN) and accompanying data of citizens in places where there's already some structure around the voter identification will be used as the deriving data for their private keys which will generate multiple random public keys that'll be used to cast votes. On election day, based on the accompanying data which specifies the polling unit, ward, local government or district, and state of the voter, a token for each poll to be cast is sent to the wallet of the voter to be deposited into the corresponding wallet address for their candidate's political party and the total amount of tokens sent to a political party's wallet for a particular poll is the total number of votes they got. The tokens in this case will only be sent to the voter's wallet after the log into their wallet with their biometric the same way their biometric data will be used to accredit them at their polling unit before they cast their votes.

<p>To initiate the voting process, the voter registers to vote with a governing body. Registering authorities require trustworthy methods for guaranteeing the person who shows up is allowed to be a participating voter. The governing authorities need to be able to support the voters' user requests, in online interactions, the election authority needs the support channels with methods to help registered users recover lost accounts, prevent account theft, and deal with identity theft attempts. Voters want a method of ensuring their vote went to their choice and not to some other option. A voter ID account would have long term implications for security, maintenance, and education. This would be a long term point of contact between the governing body and the voter, data privacy and security are imperative. One time use public-private key pairings may be part of the underlying technology, regardless the user experience needs to reflect the typical login process.</p>

### Political Registrations Example
1. Full Name (First and Last Name / Business Name DBA)
2. Government ID (Unique Identifier)
3. Address (Physical Address for political zoning)
4. Voting Party (If registered)

<p>Rules for voter registration vary across the globe, many have a minimum identification requirement. Any blockchain ID solution should meet these minimum requirements, while also allowing election authorities to design elections based on the rules of their districts. Voters must be able to easily use the system by experiencing little to no transition difficulties. The voter wants to keep their identity safe, to know that their vote is correctly cast, and to keep their identity anonymous. Additionally, users will need the ability to change their political parties, update their contact information, and voting qualifications, for instance if they move to a different voting district.</p>

### Benefits and Drawbacks
The benefits here outweigh the drawbacks regardless of the legitimate viewpoint and will be looked at side-by-side. Making the electoral process blockchain based makes it possible for citizens to access and monitor election results in real-time on the blockchain explorer. The fact that election results can now be monitored in real-time, the possibility of hijacking and altering election results before they make it to election collation centres. As the younger generation increasingly gets less interested in nation politics, they tend to rather not go through the stress of leaving their houses and trekking to their polling unit to vote on election days, especially when the political climate seems like it's not going to change in their favour, the option of being able to vote from the comfort of their home is a welcome development. It gives them a way to participate in the electoral process within their comfort zone.

The multiple random public keys ensure proper anonymity due to its inherent inability to be reverse-engineered, and the public keys only last a limited time so they can't be used to vote in two separate occasions and thus, can't be cracked by social engineering. If most of the population chooses to vote from the comfort of their homes, malicious entities that disrupt the electoral processes by snatching ballot boxes and destroying other election materials will have less to destroy and thus cause little to no disruptions to the electoral process because people could simply switch to their devices when such disruptions happen and their votes will still count. The cost of election disruption will outweigh the benefits by far that it'll discourage thuggery. Efforts would have to be changed to DDOS attacks and cybersecurity incident plans would still need to be created by each election authority.

An obvious drawback is the fact that not everyone has access to a smartphone or internet service and so full blockchain-based elections can't work. To combat that, the elections will still happen like normal but the verification and accreditation of voters will happen using blockchain technology so that it can be synchronised with the database of voters, while the mobile extension acts as an auxiliary means of voting until internet services are available everywhere. The possibility of two (2) options for the electoral process raises another challenge which is the possibility of "double voting" but the synchronised database helps tackle that. Once voters are accredited on their devices by logging into their wallets using their UID, they will not be able to be accredited by the electoral officer at their polling units because it'll show that they've already been cleared to vote on their device. Same applies if they're accredited by the electoral officer at their polling units and then they try to login on their device to cast a second vote, they'd be able to login but no voting tokens will be sent to them.

## PLATFORM

### Platform Name: IDVault
### Ticker: IDVT

The name "IDVault" for the platform was chosen considering several essential reasons. Security and Privacy: The use of the word "Vault" in the name immediately conveys a sense of security and data protection. This aligns perfectly with the goal of our project to ensure the integrity of electoral data and reduce fraud. 

Identification: The prefix "ID" suggests identification, which is crucial in the electoral context.  It indicates that the "IDVault" platform is dedicated to the secure management of electoral identifications. 

The name also implies the ability to store verified and audited records transparently, which is essential for ensuring the integrity of electoral processes. Lastly, "IDVault" is short, simple, and memorable, which will facilitate its adoption by voters, electoral authorities, and other stakeholders.

The name of the token, "IDVault Token," is a natural extension of the platform's name. It provides an identity to the token used within our platform system. Here's why this token name is appropriate:

Continuity: The inclusion of the word "Token" after "IDVault" clearly indicates that it is the digital currency associated with the platform. This creates logical continuity.

Trust and Verification: "Vault" suggests security, while "Token" evokes the concept of trust in a digital system. Together, "IDVault Token" suggests a trustworthy digital currency that can be used to verify and audit electoral records. Just like the platform's name, "IDVault Token" is easy to understand for users and stakeholders.

In summary, the platform name "IDVault" and the token name "IDVault Token" are wise choices for our synthesis project. They embody security, trust, and verification, which are essential elements in achieving our project's goals related to reducing electoral fraud and improving the efficiency of electoral processes.

### Platform Token
#### Ticker: IDVT

The acronym "IDVT" stands for "IDVault Token." This abbreviation has been carefully chosen to reflect the core mission and vision of our project. Here's how it embodies these key ideas:

Electoral Integrity: The prefix "ID" suggests identification, which is crucial in the electoral context. It indicates that "IDVault Token" is specifically designed to ensure the integrity of electoral identifications, thus contributing to the reduction of electoral fraud.

Security and Trust: The word "Vault" immediately inspires a sense of security and data protection. It suggests that this token is a trusted digital currency used in a secure environment to guarantee the authenticity of electoral records.

Transparent Verification: "Token" clearly indicates that it is a digital unit used for transparently verifying and validating electoral records. This underscores the project's objective of enabling independent and instant verification.

Efficiency: By using "IDVT" as the abbreviation, we demonstrate our commitment to improving the efficiency of electoral processes by leveraging blockchain technology for efficient verification. This abbreviation, "IDVT," is more than just a symbol; it embodies the fundamental principles of the project aimed at reducing electoral fraud and enhancing election efficiency through verifiable audit trails. It will serve as a symbol of integrity and trust for voters, electoral authorities, and investors interested in our mission.

### Token Supply: 100,000,000,000 IDVT

The aim of our project is to ensure significant adoption of the "IDVault" platform for independent and efficient verification of electoral records. In line with the recommendation, we propose a maximum of 100,000,000,000 IDVT tokens in our supply chain. Our project aims to revolutionize the way elections are conducted by making the process more transparent and efficient through verifiable audit trails. A substantial token supply is essential to support widespread adoption of the platform, which is necessary to achieve our ambitious vision.

A larger token reserve will encourage active participation from all stakeholders, including voters, electoral authorities, political parties, and election observers. This ensures that the platform will be effectively used to reduce electoral fraud and inefficiencies. A significant token supply will address the growing demand for electoral record verification. As more elections adopt our solution, it will be crucial to have enough tokens to ensure the platform can evolve and adapt rapidly. With a substantial token reserve, we can create a sustainable ecosystem where stakeholders are actively engaged. This will foster long-term trust and
acceptance of the platform.

It is important to note that a large quantity of tokens does not necessarily mean a dilution of value. The design of our economic and governance system will ensure that the token value remains stable and aligned with the success of the platform. We also plan to reserve a portion of the tokens for educational and awareness initiatives to inform voters about the importance of electoral verification and new technologies. The token reserve will be managed transparently and in compliance with regulations, with governance mechanisms to ensure appropriate use of funds and collective decision-making.

In summary, a maximum of 100,000,000,000 IDVT tokens in our supply chain will support our goal of reducing electoral fraud and inefficiencies through verifiable audit trails by ensuring widespread adoption of the platform and active participation of all stakeholders.

### Platform Blockchain – Exploration
<p>IDVault, as a Layer 2 platform powered by the IDVault Token, our users would experience significantly lowered transaction fees reducing government election costs, election officials would access programmable features via smart contracts enabling the standardization and templating of election ballot designs, and be independently verifiable by any voter that wanted to verify their own vote. While running on a Layer 1 platform like Althash, we see the increased transparency available in publically maintained blockchains, can secure election results to a public chain, and enable publically auditable and immutable records. We also keep the ability for independent verifiers to run their own blockchain nodes.</p>

<p>Choosing Althash and HTMLCoin as the layer 1 blockchain platform for our project is a strategic decision driven by their unique strengths. Althash offers a robust and secure blockchain infrastructure that is well-suited for the intricate requirements of digital identity and voting systems. Its commitment to decentralized solutions and innovative consensus mechanisms aligns seamlessly with our vision for transparent and tamper-resistant audit trails. HTMLCoin, known for its versatility and user-friendly development environment, complements Althash by providing a flexible platform for the implementation of smart contracts and decentralized applications. Together, this dual-layer approach leverages the strengths of both Althash and HTMLCoin, ensuring a resilient and scalable foundation for our project. The synergy between these platforms not only enhances the security and reliability of our digital identity and voting systems but also fosters an environment conducive to continuous innovation in the evolving landscape of blockchain technology.</p>

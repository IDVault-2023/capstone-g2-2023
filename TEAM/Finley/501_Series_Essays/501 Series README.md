### 501 C: Reflection Essay on Tokenomics is Not Economics by Michael Noel

In the ever-evolving landscape of digital currencies and blockchain technology, the terms "tokenomics" and "economics" are often used interchangeably. However, a closer look reveals that these concepts, while sharing some surface similarities, diverge significantly in their theories and applications. Tokenomics, a term that gained prominence post-Ethereum, explores the intricate behaviors within blockchain projects, influenced by speculation and regulatory frameworks. On the other hand, economics encompasses a broader scope, delving into the overarching behaviors of international, national, regional, and local trade.

The evolution of tokenomics from its pre-Ethereum days to the current state is marked by transformative shifts in focus and functionality. Initially centered around mining, staking, and speculative trading, the introduction of smart contracts on the Ethereum platform revolutionized the landscape. Ethereum, heralded as a public supercomputer, offered a platform for decentralized application (dApp) development. During the early days, smart contracts were accessible to a wide user base with reasonable gas prices. However, the surge in speculation and network usage led to skyrocketing gas fees, rendering it impractical for regular users and increasingly challenging for dApp development.

Today, the exorbitant gas prices on the Ethereum network have prompted developers to seek alternative solutions, including Layer 2 solutions and the creation of independent chains with reduced transaction fees. This shift is not merely a technical adaptation; it has broader implications, especially for low-income developers who face barriers to participation in the blockchain ecosystem due to high transaction costs. As the Ethereum network struggles to accommodate growing demand, other blockchains are seizing the opportunity to establish low-cost environments that facilitate the seamless launch of dApps.

The question arises: in a scenario where usage is high and trading prices are soaring, are smart contracts still affordable? The answer is a resounding no. There exists a critical threshold beyond which pursuing smart contracts becomes financially unviable for users. This dilemma exposes a fundamental flaw in the current blockchain system, reminiscent of the pay-to-play issues prevalent in centralized banking systems. The essence of tokenomics lies in providing financial freedom and regular access to blockchains.

When these core tenets are compromised due to exorbitant transaction costs, the very essence of the tokenomics system is jeopardized, mirroring the challenges seen in centralized financial systems.Attempts to label tokenomics as economics can be seen as part of a broader trend where centralized entities seek to regulate and control the decentralized and unregulated aspects of blockchain technology. While there are superficial similarities, such as the presence of economic elements, the fundamental differences between tokenomics and traditional economics should not be overlooked.In traditional economics, the focus is on the macro-level dynamics of international, national, and local trade, addressing issues such as inflation, monetary policies, and trade balances. Tokenomics, however, operates within the microcosm of blockchain projects, navigating the intricacies of decentralized networks, smart contracts, and token value. The attempt to equate the two is akin to trying to fit a square peg into a round hole—superficially similar, but fundamentally incompatible.

One of the critical distinctions lies in the decentralization ethos inherent in blockchain technology. Tokenomics, as a subset of this technology, aims to empower individuals with financial autonomy. In contrast, traditional economics often grapples with centralized control mechanisms, where financial freedom may be limited. The parallel drawn between tokenomics and economics often stems from the need to understand and analyze the economic implications of blockchain projects. However, conflating the two risks overlooking the unique features and challenges presented by tokenomics.

Furthermore, the comparison underscores the challenges faced by blockchain projects in maintaining accessibility and inclusivity. The escalating transaction costs on popular networks like Ethereum highlight the urgent need for scalable solutions that ensure widespread participation. The push towards Layer 2 solutions and the development of alternative blockchains signal a collective effort to address these issues and create a more sustainable and inclusive blockchain ecosystem.

In conclusion, while the terms tokenomics and economics may seem interchangeable on the surface, a deeper exploration reveals their fundamental differences. Tokenomics operates within the microcosm of blockchain projects, focusing on decentralized networks, smart contracts, and token value, while economics addresses macro-level dynamics in international, national, and local trade. The challenges faced by tokenomics, particularly in the context of rising transaction costs, emphasize the need for innovative solutions to ensure the continued growth and accessibility of blockchain technology. As the ecosystem continues to evolve, recognizing and navigating these distinctions will be crucial for stakeholders seeking to harness the true potential of tokenomics.

### 501 D: Reflection Essay on Algorithmic Stablecoins by ICORBP

Stablecoins were created by cryptocurrency developers as an effort to help reduce the wild fluctuations that are commonly seen on cryptocurrency exchanges. An algorithmic stablecoin can be pegged to anything of value, typically they're pegged to fiat currencies which fluctuate based on the global markets. In any case, the term stablecoin is a  misnomer in that the items that the coins are pegged to remain subject to fluctuations on the global market.

The historic volatility of cryptocurrency markets actually has a lot to do with scams that are known as Pump and Dumps, where the developers of the cryptocurrency would pump up the promise of a product and then dump their shares (cash out) when the price rose. Initially, the desire from developers was to create cryptocurrency marketplace stability and to reassure mainstream users of the similarity to fiat currencies. People wanted the privacy of cryptocurrency and the stability of fiat currency exchange.

I feel like pegging anything to fiat currency is building instant instability into the coin. Maybe I'm a pessimist after the Great Recession experience. Or, maybe I'm a realist and I see that the decentralized point of cryptocurrency is not to be tied to the same centralized forces which caused the monetary policy messes we see today. Perhaps we need to find cryptocurrency stability in multiple ways with stablecoins as but one path to the goal. I shudder at the thought of a centralized bank creating a cryptocurrency and that being offered as a stablecoin.

### 501 G: Reflection Essay on Luna Crash and the Future of Cryptocurrency by ICORBP

Luna was the native token created for Terra blockchain. Luna was part of an algorithmic stable coin pairing UST, which utilized algorithms instead of traditional real assets (ex. fiat currency like the US Dollar) to maintain price stability on cryptocurrency markets. Tethering the coins together was supposed to help with stability, but when the UST coin price dropped below the peg price, it actually pulled Luna down. The sudden shock of a stable coin losing value caused a run on the markets by Luna and UST holders who wanted out of the market before they lost everything.

Two important lessons can be instantly gleaned from the Luna case study. First, stability of a coin can't come from another unstable coin. The stabilizer value needs to be derived from off-chain assets. Second, cryptocurrency markets are fragile ecosystems that can be manipulated by whales with large holdings or by minnow groups working together to raise prices prior to dumping their holdings. In either case, market manipulation is a costly crime that effectively wipes out wealth of small stakeholders.

The future of cryptocurrency should include methods of securing assets that don't rely on tokens within the same blockchain. The volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets makes it imperative that investors minimize their risks by understanding the implications of their investments, the teams building the cryptocurrencies, and regulatory frameworks that control development. There's no way to completely isolate oneself from market volatility when scams are abundant and crashes are part of the normal experience for cryptocurrency investors.

### 501 H: Reflection Essay on Cycles of Market Emotions by ICORBP

Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile markets for investors. The associated risks of investing in cryptocurrency on unregulated markets has kept traditional investors on the sidelines. Meanwhile new investors (aka people with no history of traditional investing) are losing their life savings to pump and dump schemes. While it is tempting to blame the volatility on developers with nefarious motives, the truth is that any group working together can create panic or hype on any token regardless of their involvement in the development.

Scammers know that cryptocurrency affords a fractional investment opportunity for low income investors that traditional markets habitually ignore. These scammers utilize the cycle of market emotions to take advantage of new cryptocurrency investors. To do this as a pump and dump, first they hype up a coin and drive unsuspecting newcomers into a FOMO (fear of missing out) purchase. Once the coin buy price reaches a predetermined ceiling, the scammers then dump their holdings for cash out. The latecomers are left with worthless cryptocurrency and the scammers have gotten obscenely rich.
 
FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) are used as controls to help push prices down. Scammers using these tactics will raise questions and make claims about a cryptocurrency with the intention of driving down prices so that they can buy it for less. Stop hunters also like to buy in the dips, they look for stop losses and actively attempt to trigger them. These tactics are used with the intention of getting people to panic sell out of the hope of limiting their overall losses. Once the market fear subsides, the price goes back up and the FUDsters & stop hunters sell for profit. The cycle seems to be create, hype, trade, dip, repeat. Is any market driven by logic or is it all irrational fear based trading? Markets are made by people and people make a lot of decisions based on avoiding hurt and staying away from things they fear.
